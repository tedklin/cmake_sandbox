## VScode-specific differences

I haven't found a good way to get VSCode to recognize gtest headers (since my CMake config pulls it directly from git during the build process), so my workaround right now is to have a folder named hidden_ext_libs with a copy of gtest's source code. That folder is included in the gitignore to not pollute the repository (the entire project build completely ignores it anyways). I then manually add that folder to VSCode's include path for autocomplete support.
